All these files are necessary for successful compilation with NetCDF . In particular, the netcdf.mod file must be created by the same Fortran compiler as OpenSWPC .

Parameters UC Unit conversion coefficient from the computation unit (a mixed unit system using km for distance, g/cm ^3 for mass density, and km/s for seismic wave velocity) to the SI unit.

If MP=DP (this is the default), the key calculation of the finite difference will be performed in double precision, while the other calculations are in single precision. If one changes it to MP=SP , all calculation will be done in single precision. In this case, the memory used in the 3D simulation is 2/3 as much as in the MP=DP case, and compuational speed also is faster than the default.

If this number is greater than 1 , anelastic attenuation is automatically adjusted so that Q-values are approximately frequency independent in a frequency range specified by the paramreters fq_* . If this parameter is zero, the simulation is performed under the assumption of perfectly elastic body, and thus no intrinsic attenuation is taken into account.

In this case, the memory used in the 3D simulation is 2/3 as much as in the MP=DP case, and compuational speed also is faster than the default. On the other hand, single-precision calculation may lead numerical instability around the earthquake source after long-term integration. The values of DP and SP may differ at different compiler, but usually they take 8 and 4 . NM Number of viscoelastic bodies adopted in the generalized Zener body. If this number is greater than 1 , anelastic attenuation is automatically adjusted so that Q-values are approximately frequency independent in a frequency range specified by the paramreters fq_* . If this parameter is zero, the simulation is performed under the assumption of perfectly elastic body, and thus no intrinsic attenuation is taken into account. For 3D simulations, this parameter significantly affects the computation time and required memory size.","title":"Parameters embedded in the source code"},{"location":"English/1._SetUp/1-4_dataset/","text":"Preparing the Dataset \u00b6 Subsurface Velocity Structure Model \u00b6 In OpenSWPC , a 3D inhomogeneous medium is represented as a set of velocity discontinuities using NetCDF -formatted files. As an example of the velocity structure beneath the Japanese Archipelago, an automatic model generation script for the Japan Integrated Velocity Structure Model (JIVSM), developed and originally distributed by the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion in Japan, is included. An extension of JIVSM (eJIVSM), which covers a wider area, is also provided. These velocity structure models contain the ground surface (topography and bathymetry), subsurface soil, Moho, and oceanic crust of the two subducting plates. To generate these models, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is required. If the user does not use this model, thefollowing processing steps may not be necessary. Model area and vertical cross sections of JIVSM/eJIVSM Area of JIVSM and eJIVSM. The colored area in the map is where the original JIVSM is defined. eJIVSM is extended to the gray-shaded area via an extrapolation. The surrounding graphs show the depth sections along the lines on the map of the model. First, download the original model files lp2012nankai-e_str.zip and lp2012nankai-w_str.zip and store them in dataset/vmodel . The URLs of these files can be found in the comments of the gen_JIVSM.sh script. To generate eJIVSM, the ETOPO1 ( ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd ) topography data are also necessary. Then, specify the Fortran compiler name to FC variables in the params.sh parameter file. The grid spacing ( dlon , dlat ) in the parameter file can be modified if necessary. Note that this spacing is not directly related to the grid width of the numerical simulations. At the time of the simulation, the OpenSWPC program automatically interpolates the velocity model data. After these steps, execute the generation script: 1 $ ./gen_JIVSM.sh After a successful execution, 23 NetCDF -formatted files will be generated in the two model directories for JIVSM and eJIVSM . These files can be read and visualized in GMT by the grdimage or grd2xyz modules. The netcdf filename contains five integer numbers, which correspond to mass density (in kg/m {}^3 ), P wavespeed (m/s), S wavespeed (m/s), Q_P , and Q_S . They indicate the material information below the discontinuity defined in the file. List files of these NetCDF files ( jivsm.lst and ejivsm.lst ) for use in the OpenSWPC will also be generated. Station list \u00b6 An example script to generate a station list file is stored in dataset/station/gen_stlst_hinet.sh . This script generates a formatted list of the high-sensitivity seismograph network Japan (Hi-net) provided by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). To use this script, first download the station csv list from the Hi-net website following the comments in the gen_stlst_hinet.sh file. Then, executing this bash script will result in the station list file for OpenSWPC . On Embedding Parameters \u00b6 Although most of the behavior of OpenSWPC is controlled dynamically by the input parameter file, several parameters are embedded in the source code to achieve high-computational performance, as described below. These parameters are defined in src/swpc_??/m_global.F90 . If these parameters are modified, re-compilation is necessary. Parameters UC A number to convert the simulation results into the SI unit system. Modifications may be necessary to use a different unit system. The default values are 1e-15 (3D) and 1e-12 (2D). MP Precision of the finite-difference computation. By default ( MP=DP ), i.e., parts of the computation are performed in double precision, while other unnecessary variables are defined and calculated in single precision to save memory space and computation time. The user may change it to MP=SP to switch the entire computation to single precision, which will decrease the required memory up to 2/3 and allow faster computation speeds. However, in this case, a noisy seismic waveform might be observed, in particular, near the seismic source due to the overflow of floating point numbers. NM Number of generalized Zener viscoelastic bodies. If this number is larger than 1, it represents a nearly frequency-independent constant Q model in a specified frequency range. If this is set to zero, the simulation will be conducted with an elastic body without attenuation. Increasing this number enables the reproduction of a wider frequency range of constant Q ; however, it may also result in a significant increase in the computational loads for 3D simulations.","title":"Preparing the Dataset"},{"location":"English/1._SetUp/1-4_dataset/#preparing-the-dataset","text":"","title":"Preparing the Dataset"},{"location":"English/1._SetUp/1-4_dataset/#subsurface-velocity-structure-model","text":"In OpenSWPC , a 3D inhomogeneous medium is represented as a set of velocity discontinuities using NetCDF -formatted files.

The computation is performed in Cartesian coordinates. We adopt the computational coordinate system depicted in the Figure. Figure (a) Partitioning of the computational domain for MPI.

They cover the region of xbeg \\le x \\le xend , ybeg \\le y \\le yend , and zbeg \\le z \\le zend . Note that the z -axis is defined as positive downward. Because the free surface is usually defined at z=0 , it is recommended to let zbeg be a negative value to include the free surface in the model. The volume is discretized into nx , ny , and nz grids with spatial grid widths of dx , dy , and dz , respectively, in each direction.

The geographical coordinate is projected onto the Cartesian coordinate by the Gauss--Kr\u00fcger transform as follows (see Figure below): First generate an evenly spaced grid in Cartesian coordinates from the input parameters phi and those related to the x, y coordinates. Project the grid location onto the geographical coordinate by using the Gauss--Kr\u00fcger transform with a center location of ( clon , clat ). Obtain the medium parameter at the grid location via a bicubic interpolation of the input velocity structure model. If the specified area exceeds that of the input velocity model, the outermost value of the velocity structure is used for the extrapolation.

Figure Staggered grid layout in 3D space for the case of xbeg=ybeg=zbeg=0 The unit volume shown in the figure is defined as a \"voxel\" at the grid indices ( I,J,K ). A grid location x belongs to the voxel number \\begin{align} I = \\left \\lceil \\frac{ x-x_{\\text{beg}} }{ \\Delta x } \\right \\rceil, \\end{align} and if the voxel number I is given, its center coordinate location is \\begin{align} x = x_{\\text{beg}} + \\left( I - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\Delta x \\end{align} where \\lceil \\cdot \\rceil is a ceiling function and x_{\\text{beg}} is the minimum value of the x -coordinate. Note that x_{\\text{beg}} is set to belong to the voxel I=1 . A voxel has a volume of \\begin{align} \\begin{split} x_\\text{beg} + (I-1)\\Delta x < x \\le x_\\text{beg} + I \\Delta x, \\\\ y_\\text{beg} + (J-1)\\Delta y < y \\le y_\\text{beg} + J \\Delta y, \\\\ z_\\text{beg} + (K-1)\\Delta z < z \\le z_\\text{beg} + K \\Delta z \\end{split} \\end{align} The normal stress tensor components are defined at the center of the voxel, the shear stress is defined on the edge, and velocity vector components are defined on its surface. Medium parameters are defined at the center of the voxel at \\begin{align} x_\\text{beg} + (I-1/2) \\Delta x, \\quad y_\\text{beg} + (J-1/2) \\Delta y, \\quad z_\\text{beg} + (K-1/2) \\Delta z \\end{align} If necessary, averaging will be performed between neighboring voxels. Stability and Wavelength Conditions \u00b6 The spatial grid width, \\Delta x , \\Delta y , and \\Delta z , and the time step width, \\Delta t , must satisfy the stability condition. The stability condition in N_D -dimensional space for the order of the finite difference method P is given by \\begin{align} \\Delta t < \\frac{ 1 }{ V_{\\max} } \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N_D} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i^2} \\right)^{-1/2} \\left( \\sum_{p=1}^{P/2} C_p\\right) ^{-1} \\end{align} where V_{\\max} is the maximum velocity of the medium, C_p are the coefficients of the finite difference formula, and \\Delta x_i is the spatial grid width in the i -th direction. For the fourth-order formula of the finite difference method, which is used in the code, the coefficients are C_1 = 9/8 and C_2 = 1/24 . For example, for the fourth-order finite difference with isotropic grid sizes ( \\Delta x = \\Delta y =\\Delta z = h ) in three-dimensional space, the stability condition is reduced to \\begin{align} \\Delta t < \\frac{6}{7} \\dfrac{1}{V_{\\max} \\sqrt{ \\dfrac{1}{\\Delta x^2} + \\dfrac{1}{\\Delta y^2} +\\dfrac{1}{\\Delta z^2}}} = \\frac{6 h}{7 \\sqrt{3} V_{\\max}} \\simeq 0.495 \\frac{h}{V_{\\max}}. \\end{align} This condition can be interpreted as \"the distance that the seismic wave propagates within a single time step must be much smaller than the spatial grid width.\" The numerical simulation will diverge immediately if this condition is not satisfied. In addition, the minimum wavelength of the simulated seismic waves should be much longer than the spatial grid width . If the wavelength becomes relatively small compared to this condition, a fictitious numerical dispersion will appear and result into inaccurate later phases. Usually, the wavelength is taken to be longer than 5--10 times the spatial grid width to avoid this effect. Therefore, the minimum velocity (usually the S-wave velocity) in the velocity model should be selected carefully. One may specify a smaller spatial grid size to avoid this problem; however, in this case, the time-step size must also be shortened to satisfy the stability condition. \u3053\u308c\u3089\u5b89\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u3068\u6ce2\u9577\u6761\u4ef6\u306f\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u5b9f\u884c\u958b\u59cb\u6642\u306b\u6a19\u6e96\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u51fa\u529b\u306b Stability Condition c \u304a\u3088\u3073 Wavelength Condition r \u3068\u3057\u3066\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff0e\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\uff0c\u5b89\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u3068\u6642\u9593\u523b\u307f\u306e\u6bd4\u304a\u3088\u3073\u69cb\u9020\u4e2d\u306e\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u9577\u3068\u7a7a\u9593\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u6bd4\u3092\u610f\u5473\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\uff0e Parameters nproc_x , nproc_y Number of partitions in the x - and y -directions.

One may specify a smaller spatial grid size to avoid this problem; however, in this case, the time-step size must also be shortened to satisfy the stability condition. \u3053\u308c\u3089\u5b89\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u3068\u6ce2\u9577\u6761\u4ef6\u306f\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u5b9f\u884c\u958b\u59cb\u6642\u306b\u6a19\u6e96\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u51fa\u529b\u306b Stability Condition c \u304a\u3088\u3073 Wavelength Condition r \u3068\u3057\u3066\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff0e\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\uff0c\u5b89\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u3068\u6642\u9593\u523b\u307f\u306e\u6bd4\u304a\u3088\u3073\u69cb\u9020\u4e2d\u306e\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u9577\u3068\u7a7a\u9593\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u6bd4\u3092\u610f\u5473\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\uff0e Parameters nproc_x , nproc_y Number of partitions in the x - and y -directions.

For snapshot files, the user may choose from an originally defined binary format (obsolete and not recommended) or a NetCDF file (recommended). The waveforms are usually exported in SAC format. The endian conversion is not performed at the time of the data output. However, the official libraries of NetCDF and SAC automatically detect the endian format and convert them if necessary. Therefore, users do not have to worry about the differences in endian formats between machines. There is a utility program to read the original-formatted data.

Thanks to these rules, output NetCDF files of OpenSWPC can be directly read by many scientific visualization tools, such as ParaView, Panoply or GMT. Snapshot Data Output \u00b6 Spatiotemporal snapshot output may be created along cross sections of xy , yz , and xz profiles on the topography ( fs ) and/or on the bathymetry ( ob ). There are three types of snapshots: divergence and rotation of the velocity ( ps ), velocity ( v ), and displacement ( u ). The use of spatial and temporal decimations is recommended to reduce the I/O load and export data size. Decimation in time is specified by ntdec_s starting from it=0 (before starting the computation). In space, the decimations are performed by factors of idec , jdec , and kdec , and OpenSWPC tries to export the center of the decimation window, as schematically shown in the following figure. The numbers of exporting grids in each MPI node do not necessarily need to be the same for each node. The amplitudes of these snapshot points will be gathered to specific nodes and exported as single files. Figure Schematic of the spatial decimation for the snapshot output. The vertical dotted lines show the borders of the MPI nodes. In this example, the data at the blue grids will be exported as the snapshot data. The snapshot data will be exported from different node of computation to ballance the computational loads. section type output node yz PS 0 xz PS mod(1, nproc) xy PS mod(2, nproc) fs PS mod(3, nproc) ob PS mod(4, nproc) yz V mod(5, nproc) xz V mod(6, nproc) xy V mod(7, nproc) fs V mod(8, nproc) ob V mod(9, nproc) yz U mod(10, nproc) xz U mod(11, nproc) xy U mod(12, nproc) fs U mod(13, nproc) ob U mod(14, nproc) Parameters snp_format Datafile format of the snapshot files: \"native\" (original binary format; obsolete) or \"netcdf\" (recommended).

Snapshots will be exported every ntdec_s time steps. idec , jdec , kdec Spatial decimation factor of the snapshot output for the x , y , and z directions. Seismic Waveform Output \u00b6 Seismic velocity and/or displacement records at specified stations can be obtained as SAC-formatted files by setting the parameters sw_wav_v and/or sw_wav_u to .true. . Displacement records are calculated before the decimation, and therefore, they are expected to be more accurate than performing a numerical integration of the output velocity records. The traces are stored in the memory during the computation and are exported at the end. Station locations are given in Cartesian coordinates ( xy ) or geographical coordinates ( ll ), as in the following table. In the station list, lines starting with # will be ignored. Type Format 'xy' x y z name zsw 'll' lon lat z name zsw The depth of the station can be changed depending on the variable zsw in the station list, as shown in the next table.

Usually, it is recommended to set zsw=\u2019obb\u2019 ; this setting locates stations one-grid level below the ground surface (or seafloor). Multiple stations can be specified in the station list file. There is no fixed limit on the number of stations. The number of stations is automatically counted, and only the stations inside the computational region will be exported. Parameters sw_wav_v , sw_wav_u .true. for exporting velocity ( sw_wav_v ) and displacement ( sw_wav_v`) traces. ntdec_w Decimation factor of the waveform output. For ntdec_w=1 , traces at every computational time step will be exported. st_format :Format of the station list file. See the above table. fn_stloc Station location filename. wav_format Station file format: \u2019sac\u2019 (usual, recommended) or \u2019csf\u2019 . Strain and stress output \u00b6 By specifying sw_wav_strain = .true. and sw_wav_stress = .true. , users can obtain strain and stress time series as a SAC-formatted data file as in the case of velocity and displacement ( Experimental; new in version 5.0 ). The specification of station locations are same with the case of velocity/displacement. The output units are nondimensional for strain and [Pa] for stress data. Distance calculation mode \u00b6 In default, OpenSWPC will store the station location via stlo and stla headers of SAC , and SAC program will automatically calculate the epicentral distance. However if the input station location is given in xy coordinate and distance if very long, the error originated from the map projection is not negilible. In such cases, one may calculate epicentral distance in the OpenSWPC and store to the epdist header of SAC files, and prohibit SAC to overwright the distance header. Parameters wav_calc_dist If this parameter is .true. , calculate and store the epicentral distance and store it to the SAC header. The csf format \u00b6 Because the SAC format is defined to express the data at one component of one station in a single file, the number of files may become extraordinarily large. In this case, data transfer between computers will become very inefficient. For OpenSWPC version 3.0 or later, users can choose a concatenated SAC format (csf) for the data output by specifying wav_format=\u2019csf\u2019 . This is a set of SAC binary files connected to a single file, with headers as in the following: CSF header format identifier Fixed to 'CSFD' ntrace Number of traces in the file npts Number of samples in a trace It is assumed that the number of samples ( ntpts ) are in common in the csf format. If the csf format is selected, each parallel computation node exports waveforms in the corresponding domain into csf files for every components. Output Filename Conventions \u00b6 Output data names are determined by the following rules: Snapshot \u2006\u2006\u2006 (odir)/(title).(section).(type).(ext) Waveform (SAC) \u2006\u2006\u2006 (odir)/wav/(title).(stnm).(component).sac Waveform (CSF) \u2006\u2006\u2006 (odir)/wav/(title).(node-ID).(component).csf Computation time \u2006\u2006 (odir)/wav/(title).tim In the above rules, (section) takes a cross section such as xy or yz . (type) takes v or ps depending on the snapshot data type. (component) takes Vx , Vy , or Vz for the velocity or Ux , Uy , or Uz for the displacement. Extension of the snapshot ext will be nc for NetCDF and snp for the native format.","title":"Simulation Data Output"},{"location":"English/2._Parameter_Settings/0205_output/#simulation-data-output","text":"","title":"Simulation Data Output"},{"location":"English/2._Parameter_Settings/0205_output/#output-datafile-format","text":"OpenSWPC can export two types of data: spatiotemporal snapshots and the seismic waveform at stations.

In space, the decimations are performed by factors of idec , jdec , and kdec , and OpenSWPC tries to export the center of the decimation window, as schematically shown in the following figure. The numbers of exporting grids in each MPI node do not necessarily need to be the same for each node. The amplitudes of these snapshot points will be gathered to specific nodes and exported as single files. Figure Schematic of the spatial decimation for the snapshot output. The vertical dotted lines show the borders of the MPI nodes. In this example, the data at the blue grids will be exported as the snapshot data. The snapshot data will be exported from different node of computation to ballance the computational loads. section type output node yz PS 0 xz PS mod(1, nproc) xy PS mod(2, nproc) fs PS mod(3, nproc) ob PS mod(4, nproc) yz V mod(5, nproc) xz V mod(6, nproc) xy V mod(7, nproc) fs V mod(8, nproc) ob V mod(9, nproc) yz U mod(10, nproc) xz U mod(11, nproc) xy U mod(12, nproc) fs U mod(13, nproc) ob U mod(14, nproc) Parameters snp_format Datafile format of the snapshot files: \"native\" (original binary format; obsolete) or \"netcdf\" (recommended).

This parameter is used to avoid wavelengths that are too short and violate the wavelength condition (the wavelength is recommended to be longer than 5-10 grids). This substitution will not be performed in the oceanic area. On Treatments of Air and Seawater Layer \u00b6 In OpenSWPC , the air column has a mass density of \\rho=0.001 [g/cm {}^3 ], velocities of V_P = V_S = 0 [km/s], and intrinsic attenuation parameters of Q^P = Q^S = 10^{10} . In the ocean column, \\rho= 1.0 [g/cm {}^3 ], V_P = 1.5 [km/s], V_S = 0.0 [km/s], and Q^P = Q^S = 10^6 are assumed. The air column is treated as a vacuum with no seismic wave propagation (with zero velocities). However, the mass density in the air column must not be zero to avoid division by zero . In the free surface and seafloor, the reduced order of the finite difference is performed according to Okamoto and Takenaka (2005 1 ) and Maeda and Furumura (2003 2 ). These discontinuities are automatically detected as boundaries that change \\mu and \\lambda from zero to a finite value. Small-Scale Random Inhomogeneity \u00b6 Users may overlay small-scale velocity inhomogeneities with specified power-law spectra on the background velocity models of \u2019uni\u2019 , \u2019lhm\u2019 , and \u2019grd\u2019 . The small-scale velocity inhomogeneity \\xi is defined by external files. From the average velocities V_{P0} , V_{S0} , and \\rho_0 , the fluctuated velocities and density are given as \\begin{align} V_P = V_{P0} \\left( 1 + \\xi \\right) , \\, V_S = V_{S0} \\left( 1 + \\xi \\right) , \\, \\rho = \\rho_0 \\left( 1 + \\nu \\xi \\right) \\end{align} where \\nu=0.8 is a scaling parameter based on a laboratory experiment (Sato et al., 2012 3 ). Velocity models having this small-scale inhomogeneity are specified by appending _rmed to the original velocity models: vmodel_type=\u2019uni_rmed\u2019 , \u2019lhm_rmed\u2019 , or \u2019grd_rmed\u2019 . The random media files are generated by a separated program. See this section for details. Parameters dir_rmed A directory name for storing the random media data files. The random media are given as two- or three-dimensional NetCDF files. At each grid location, the velocity fluctuation \\xi(I,J,K) is defined. The code automatically reads the corresponding volume from the file; It is not necessary to decompose the NetCDF files into parts for parallel computation. If the computational size ( Nx, Ny, Nz ) is larger than the random media file size, the media is used repeatedly by applying a circular boundary condition. The simulation codes do not care if the grid sizes of the simulation and the input random media file are identical. Note that users may use the 3D random media files for 2D calculation. Parameters for uni_rmed \u00b6 The following parameter is required in addition to the parameters used in vmodel=\u2019uni\u2019 . Parameters fn_rmed0 Name of the random medium file. In this model, the average velocity will be fluctuated based on the input fn_rmed0 . Parameters for lhm_rmed \u00b6 In this model, the small-scale velocity fluctuation is applied to every layer defined by vmodel=\u2019lhm\u2019 . It is possible to assign different random velocity models at different layers. The following parameter is substituted in fn_lhm : Parameters fn_lhm_rmed List file of the velocity structure. The list file has a similar format to fn_lhm ; it contains the filenames of the random media files in the rightmost column as in the following example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # depth rho(g/cm^3) vp(km/s) vs(km/s) Qp Qs fn_rmed # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 2.300 5.50 3.14 600 300 rmedia1 . nc 3 2.400 6.00 3.55 600 300 rmedia1 . nc 18 2.800 6.70 3.83 600 300 rmedia2 . nc 33 3.200 7.80 4.46 600 300 rmedia2 . nc 100 3.300 8.00 4.57 600 300 - 225 3.400 8.40 4.80 600 300 - 325 3.500 8.60 4.91 600 300 - 425 3.700 9.30 5.31 600 300 - In this example, the layers starting from depths of 0 km and 3 km have fluctuations defined in rmedia1.nc , and the layers from 18 km and 33 km are defined in rmedia2.nc . For the layer deeper than 100 km, a dummy filename ( - ) is given. In this case (i.e., there is no file found), a fluctuation will not be given. The dummy filename is mandatory in this case. Parameters for grd_rmed \u00b6 When overlaying the random fluctuations to the layers defined by the model of vmodel=\u2019grd\u2019 , it is possible to assign different random media to different layers. The starting depth of the velocity fluctuation can be either the free surface or depths defined by a layer.

If this number is zero, the depth grid number of the computational model is directly used to assign the random media. This is exactly the same as the behavior of the uni_rmed or lhm_rmed models. If the nonzero value of the reference layer number NR is specified, the depth of the NR layer is treated as the base plane. The depth grid of the random medium is measured from this depth. Introducing this reference plane, the inclined random media according to the velocity discontinuity (such as the plate boundary) can be specified. In the above example, the 18th and 21st layers are treated as the references of 18--20th and 21--23th layers, respectively. Truncation of Velocity Fluctuations \u00b6 If the magnitude of the velocity fluctuation becomes too large, there can be a spot with non-physical velocity, such as negative velocity or a velocity too large for the Earth medium. The simulation may be unstable under the following conditions: The fluctuated velocity V=(1+\\xi)V_0 exceeds the stability condition for cases with \\xi>0 . The velocity has unrealistic negative values for cases with \\xi<-1.0 . The mass density has negative values for cases with \\xi<-1.25 . To avoid such situations, OpenSWPC automatically limits the range of the fluctuated velocity to vcut \\le v \\le 0.95 \\times v_\\text{max} , where vcut is an input parameter and v_\\text{max} is the maximum possible velocity derived from the stability condition. In addition, the following parameter controls the minimum density. Parameters rhomin Minimum mass density in g/cm {}^3 . (1.0 g/cm {}^3 by default.) Okamoto, T., and H. Takenaka (2005).

In addition, the uppermost frequency, where the spectrum response of the source time function becomes flat in the frequency domain, is approximately f \\le 1/(2 T_R) (the blue dotted line in the figure. Moment Tensor Source \u00b6 The source mechanisms of the faulting are given by a six-component moment tensor or by three parameters of a double couple source ( strike , dip , rake ). The source locations can be given either by their computational or geographical coordinates. The size of the earthquake can be described by seismic moment M_0 or moment magnitude M_W or fault slip D & area S . In total, there are ten possible formats to describe the source. In the program, sources are given as a stress-drop source by using the moment rate function. The moment rate function is chosen from the given six functions. They require parameters in the source list file for their starting time T_0 , duration T_R , and total moment M_0 . OpenSWPC can accept multiple point sources as multiple lines in the source list file. There is no fixed limit to the number of sources (in practice, this is determined by the memory size). By gradually changing the starting time and source location, a finite fault rupture can be mimicked. In the source list file, lines starting with # will be ignored. By setting sdep_fit , the source depth can be changed so that it fits the medium's velocity boundary. In this case, the depth in the source list file will be ignored. The layer number should be specified in the fn_grd or fn_grd_rmed list files. Parameters stf_format Format of the source list file. Choose from the following six candidates.

'asis' : do not fit (default). 'bd{i}' (i=1,2, \\cdots 9): fits to the i -th boundary specified in the rightmost column of fn_grdlst . Body Force Mode \u00b6 A body force source can be used instead of a moment tensor source. In this mode, the three-component force vector ( f_x , f_y , f_z ) should be specified. The force vector is assumed to have a bell-shaped source time function, as in the case of the moment tensor source. Although there is no restriction on the number of body force elements, it is not possible to use both a moment tensor and a body force at the same time. Parameters bf_mode Flag for the body force mode. If this is .true. , the following parameters are used for the body force and the moment tensor source is ignored. stf_format Format of the source file. Select from 'xy' or 'll' . Note that the source file format is different from that for the moment tensor. 'xy' : x, y, z, T_0 , T_R , f_x , f_y , f_z 'll' : lon, lat , z, T_0 , T_R , f_x , f_y , f_z stftype Choice of the source time function. Same as the case with a moment tensor source. fn_stf Filename of the source list file. sdep_fit Flag to fit the source depth to a specified velocity discontinuity. Same as the case with a moment tensor source. Plane Wave Mode \u00b6 A plane wave incident from the bottom can be used as an input source instead of the moment tensor or body force sources. In OpenSWPC , plane wave incidence is achieved by setting the velocity vector and stress tensor components based on the analytic solution of a plane wave propagating upward as the initial condition. The specification of the initial conditions includes the depth of the initial plane wave ( pw_ztop ) and its characteristic length ( pw_zlen ; corresponding to the wavelength), the strike and dip angle of the plane wave ( pw_strike , pw_dip ), and the polarization direction (rake angle) in the case of an S-wave ( pw_rake ). See the next figure for the geometry. Figure Geometry of the plane wave specification. (Left) The specification of the uppermost plane and the polarization direction. (Right) The depth cross section of the initial plane wave. The definitions of the strike, dip, and rake parameters follow those of the earthquake source fault geometry of Aki and Richards (2002[^Aki2002]). For three-dimensional space, pw_strike=0 results in the plane dip toward the y -direction (east for phi=0 ). A rake angle of pw_rake=0 {}^\\circ or pw_rake=180 {}^\\circ will result in pure SH waves whose polarization is parallel to the free surface. The initial plane wave occupies a depth range of pw_zlen (km) starting at depths of z= pw_ztop at the center of the horizontal coordinate. The depth dependence of the wave amplitude is determined by the source time functions used in the moment rate function as a function of space. Via the definition of the source time function, the integration of the initial plane wave along the propagation direction will be normalized to 1. Parameters pw_mode Flag to use the plane-wave mode.

If we denote the Green's tensor, from the virtual source \\mathbf{\\xi} to the receiver \\mathbf{r} , as G_{ij}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) , this mode simulates the convolution of the spatial derivatives of Green's tensor with the source time function s(t) as \\begin{align} \\begin{split} G^{M1}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv \\frac{\\partial G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_x} \\ast s(t) = \\frac{\\partial G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_x} \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{M2}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv \\frac{\\partial G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_y} \\ast s(t) = \\frac{\\partial G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_y} \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{M3}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv \\frac{\\partial G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_z} \\ast s(t) = \\frac{\\partial G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_z} \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{M4}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_z} + \\frac{\\partial G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_y} \\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\ &= \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_z} + \\frac{\\partial G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_y} \\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{M5}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_z} + \\frac{\\partial G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_x}\\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\& = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_z} + \\frac{\\partial G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_x}\\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{M6}_{i} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_y} + \\frac{\\partial G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_x} \\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\ &= \\left( \\frac{\\partial G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_y} + \\frac{\\partial G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) }{\\partial \\xi_x} \\right) \\ast s(t) \\end{split} \\end{align} which corresponds to the moment tensor response. Optionally, the body-force response \\begin{align} \\begin{split} G^{B1}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) \\ast s(t) = G_{ix} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{B2}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) \\ast s(t) = G_{iy} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right) \\ast s(t) \\\\ G^{B3}_{i}\\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right) &\\equiv G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{r}, t; \\mathbf{\\xi}\\right)\\ast s(t) = G_{iz} \\left( \\mathbf{\\xi}, t; \\mathbf{r}\\right)\\ast s(t) \\end{split} \\end{align} can be calculated. To use this mode, the users should specify the station name green_stnm of the receiver. This station name should be contained in the station list file. OpenSWPC radiates the seismic wave by an excitation force with a direction specified by the green_cmp parameter and a source time function of the rise time, green_trise . To obtain the full response of all components, three independent simulations with green_cmp=\u2019x\u2019 , \u2019y\u2019 , and \u2019z\u2019 are necessary. The virtual source location should be given in the Cartesian or geographical coordinates and depth (the format is described in Table [table:greenf] {reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"table:greenf\"}) with unique integer ID numbers ( gid ). Multiple virtual source locations can be specified in the simulation. The gid s do not need to be sequential. The output file is stored in the directory (odir)/green/(gid) in the SAC format with the name convention (title)__(green_cmp)__mij__.sac (for the moment tensor response) or (title)__(green_cmp)__fi__.sac (for the body force response). The amplitudes of the output files are multiplied by 10^9 to compare the SAC -formatted files in nm or nm/s units. The vertical component of the output file is changed to be positive upward. However, the derivative with respect to depth is performed according to the original definition of positive downward. Parameters green_mode :Flags to turn the reciprocity mode on. If this is .true. , the other earthquake source parameters will be ignored. green_stnm Name of the virtual station. This name must be included in the station list. green_cmp Component at the virtual receiver. Choose from \u2019x\u2019 , \u2019y\u2019 , or \u2019z\u2019 . green_trise Rise time of the source time function convolved with the simulated Green's function. green_bforce If .true. , calculate the body force response as well as the moment tensor response. The default setting is .false. . green_fmt Format specification of the virtual source location. Choose from \u2019xyz\u2019 (Cartesian coordinate; default) or \u2019llz\u2019 (longitude, latitude, and depth). green_maxdist The reciprocity wave will only be calculated if the horizontal distance is shorter than this parameter.

Same as the case with the moment tensor source. ntdec_w Temporal decimation factor of the output waveforms. Same as the case with the normal waveform output.
